# How is this repository used?
[GitOps](https://about.gitlab.com/topics/gitops/) is a modern approach to managing and maintaining software infrastructure through version-controlled code repositories like Git. It combines development best practices, such as version control and automated testing, with operations tasks like deployment and monitoring. In a nutshell, GitOps makes it easy for developers and operations teams to collaborate and maintain infrastructure by treating it as code.

IAMOps, or Identity and Access Management Operations, takes the GitOps concept and applies it to managing cloud identities and permissions. It focuses on centralizing and streamlining the tracking and management of cloud identities, access rules and user permissions using Git as the source of truth. This way, developers, operations, security, and compliance teams can work together more efficiently, applying the same best practices they use for code development to manage access and permissions across different cloud platforms.

IAMbic uses `iambic-templates` repository to keep track of changes in your cloud permissions and configurations. By using Git's branching and commit history, IAMbic can easily spot differences in your cloud settings without having to make time-consuming requests to your cloud provider.
